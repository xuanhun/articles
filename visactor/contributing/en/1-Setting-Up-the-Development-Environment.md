# Local Development Environment

## 2.1 Install Git

Since the code is hosted on GitHub, we use git for version control.

Git is a version control system that helps track and manage code changes in software development projects. It aids developers in recording and managing code history, making team collaboration, code version control, and code merging easier. With Git, you can track each version of every file, switching and comparing between different versions easily. Git also offers branch management features, enabling simultaneous multiple parallel development tasks.

*  Visit the Git official website: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)

*  Download the latest version of the Git installer.

*  Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts in the installation wizard.

*  After installation, you can verify the installation by using `git version` in the command line.

```
HM4G2J09L6:~ xuanhun$ git version
**git version 2.39.2 (Apple Git-143)**
```

## 2.2 Install a Development Tool (Recommended: VSCode)

VisActor predominantly uses a frontend tech stack. There are many tools available for frontend development, but we recommend using VSCode. Of course, you can use any development tool you prefer.

If you're not familiar with VSCode, it might be helpful to read the official documentation: https://vscode.js.cn/docs/setup/setup-overview

## 2.3 Install Doubao [Marscode AI Programming Assistant](https://www.marscode.cn/home?utm_source=developer&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=visactor_a)

Doubao MarsCode Programming Assistant is an AI coding assistant from Doubao that provides AI features represented by intelligent code completion. It supports mainstream programming languages and IDEs, offering suggestions for writing a single line of code or an entire function during development. In addition, it offers features like code explanation, unit test generation, and problem fixing, improving development efficiency and quality. For more information, please refer to the [Doubao MarsCode Programming Assistant documentation](https://www.marscode.cn/home?utm_source=developer&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=visactor_a).
