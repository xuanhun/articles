# What is the Context Doc Feature

Specifying context allows the AI assistant to provide more accurate answers. However, a large model's real-time understanding of a component is often less up-to-date than the component's official documentation. When using an unfamiliar component, if we can introduce the relevant documentation into the context, it can greatly improve the level of intelligent programming.

Trae uses "#" to specify context.

Enter "#Doc:" to index the document set. Here, we add VisActor's documentation for testing. Currently, Trae does not have any built-in document sets, so you need to add them manually.

First, add a document set:

Here, we add the entry URLs for each component via URL:

*  VChart: https://www.visactor.io/vchart/
*  VTable: https://www.visactor.io/vtable
*  VMind: https://www.visactor.io/vmind
*  ...

The whole process is a bit slow, but the indexing effect is clearly better than Cursor.

Let's test whether referencing documentation as context brings practical benefits to programming.
