## Abstract

VChart's official website welcomes a major update, launching AI Assistant and brand new sharing features. The sharing functionality supports three methods: Playground link sharing (with real-time interactive debugging), iframe embed code (easy website integration), and image export (one-click high-definition screenshot generation), fully compatible with three mainstream frameworks: native JavaScript, React, and OpenInula. Meanwhile, the AI Assistant has been upgraded with an integrated AI Q&A system in the search box for quick technical support, and the AI editing feature has been optimized with drawer-style interaction for a more immersive editing experience. These new features significantly enhance chart shareability and development efficiency, making data visualization work more efficient and convenient.

The AI assistant in VChart brings more convenience and intelligent experience to chart editing.

This improvement creates a smoother, more immersive editing environment for users, reducing external distractions and allowing users to focus more on chart editing.
